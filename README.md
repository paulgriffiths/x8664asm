x86_64 Linux Assembly Sandbox
=============================

A repository of x86_64 assembly experiments for Linux. For practice, and
for fun, the objective is to make all the programs self-contained, without
using any C standard library or other functions, necessitating the explicit
implementation of any required functionality.

Run `make` to make executable files. The Yasm assembler is required.
