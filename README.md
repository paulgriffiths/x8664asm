x86_64 Linux Assembly Sandbox
=============================

A repository of x86_64 assembly experiments for Linux. For practice, and
for fun, the objective is to make all the programs self-contained, without
using any C standard library or other functions, necessitating the explicit
implementation of any required functionality.

**NOTE**: The purpose of this project is simply to implement the required
functionality for practice in writing assembly - it is not to provide a
quality general purpose library, or to demonstrate best practice in writing
assembly. Some of these functions are inefficient - others fail to implement
even the most basic of error checking and input validation. Use at your
own risk, and do not treat this as quality code.

Run `make` to make executable files. The Yasm assembler is required.
